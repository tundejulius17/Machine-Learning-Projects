# My-Machine-Learning-Code
This repository contains some of the machine learning projects I have done.
The projects are listed below:

Bird sound detection using random forest, LSTM and CNN
k-fold cross validation for social network ads classification
PCA for wine classification using logistic regression
Kernel-PCA for wine classification using logistic regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for wine classification
